## Hi there 👋

# 👋 Welcome to my Profile!

### 🚀 About Me
I am a passionate developer who loves building projects that combine **technology and real-world impact**. 

Currently, I am **completely rethinking my main project architecture** to move from a standard development approach to a more robust **Modern Data Stack**. I'm focusing on how to transform raw data into high-value business assets using better modeling practices.

### 📊 What I Love in Data
- **Analytics Engineering** – Bridging the gap between Data Engineering and Business Analysis.
- **Data Modeling** – Designing clean, scalable Star Schemas and working with tools like **dbt**.
- **Insights & Impact** – Building dashboards that don't just look good, but actually drive decisions.
- **Automation** – Streamlining data pipelines to ensure data quality and reliability.

### 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Languages:** Python, SQL (PostgreSQL, BigQuery), JavaScript
- **Data Stack:** **dbt**, Power BI, Google BigQuery / Snowflake
- **Core Dev:** Git, Docker, React, Django
- **Concepts:** ETL/ELT, Data Warehousing, Data Visualization

### 🤝 Let's Work Together!
I am currently looking for a **1-year Apprenticeship (Alternance)** as a **Data Engineer** or **Data Analyst** starting in [Mois de début, ex: September 2026].

If you have a project, an idea, or a job opportunity, I'd love to hear from you!
